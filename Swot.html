												<h3>Alexis's Findings</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Over the course of my three years in undergrad at Kelley, I
have been apart of numerous team projects. Throughout
each, I have been able to get feedback from my peers on
what my weaknesses and strengths are. I have also
personally reflected after projects and assignments to come
to the realization of where I lack and where I flourish. My
strengths are evident in my daily work as I am always
persistent and love to solve problems. I think that these will
positively impact my success in MSIS and the work force. My
weaknesses are items that I have been working on mitigating
everyday. Over the summer, I told my team that I wanted to
present more so that I could improve upon my presentation
skills. I developed my opportunity areas by analyzing my
current situation and my short/long term goals. Currently, I
am working on recruiting for a full-time job. I want to take
every opportunity presented to increase my chances of
success. I developed my threats by analyzing my current
situation and what could deter my progress. I will work to
mitigate these by managing my time better, organizing an
agenda for each week, and trying my best at everything I take
on. </p>

      											<p>My strengths are time management, motivation, and marketing
analysis. I always plan things and leave buffer time for my
schedule to deal with emergency situations. I am motivated to
work hard and collaborate with my team. My undergrad major is
marketing which helps me learn many marketing skills that I can
use them in the MSIS program. My weaknesses are written
communication, lack of programming knowledge, easily
distracted, and not creative. My writing is not very good because
I still learning grammar. The solution is to learn more grammar
and ask for help from my lovely teammates. Although I learned
HTML, C#, and JavaScript so far, I think I’m not very good at
using these languages, so I’ll continue learning these! Easily
distracted can be solved by setting goals for every day to ensure
I spend enough time on work. I will practice my creativity by
learning from creative people in my team and my friends. For
opportunities, I have internship experience in the marketing and
technology part, so it helps me a lot in the program. Second one
is the business getting more aware of technology, which means
MSIS graduates easier to find a job. Finally, I got a chance to
communicate with native speakers every day, so I can improve
my English skills. The biggest threat we have is COVID-19. It
changed everything. We can solve this by getting used to online
communication tools. Also, the increased job market
competition leads to fewer jobs available outside. We can solve
it by actively networking and improve my skills to become
better. Finally, changing technologies are becoming more
crucial to keep up with, so I will keep learning new technologies
to ensure that I’m on track. </p>

                                  <p>I came up with my strengths by reflecting on my experiences
with school so far. So far in my group my technical skills have
stuck out, as my teammates did not have the same experience
with programming. I am able to teach others these skills, and I
do not give up. My perseverance has helped me make it through
my undergrad, and into a masters program. As a result of
teaching my teammates, they can adapt quicker, and help me
once they are caught up to speed. For my weaknesses I thought
about the classes I struggled in. I am often late to meetings, not
by much but a few minutes. To mitigate this I have started to set
alarms, and I update my calendar frequently. I also ask my
teammates for help on financials, and writing when the
assignments require these skills. So as a whole I have learned to
mitigate my weaknesses by asking my team for help. For the
threats I thought about what I am struggling with the most right
now. Since the masters began, I have been up late, and had to
juggle my social life with my school work. A big part of me
joining the program was the opportunity to meet like minded
individuals, and I have to balance this with completing my work.
Luckily everyone else in the program takes school seriously so I
just give myself one night out a week, and this satisfies me. </p>

                                        <p>During my time in college I discovered my natural strengths
of presenting, writing, and communication in general as
well as organizing work and my teammates as a leader
(when I am sufficiently knowledgeable of the material). I
have also suffered from my weakness of networking and
preparing for my future career which can cause me to be
stressed and anxious about an uncertain future, and in MSIS
I have struggled with the more technical elements like
programming as I have no experience with these concepts
beforehand, requiring a larger time commitment to learn
them. Some of my opportunities include overcoming my
weaknesses, like networking and programming as well as
just improving my time management skills, as is necessary
in MSIS. Some threats that I feel I must address are the
competition that my more professionally experienced
classmates offer in terms of networking, any struggles I may
have in learning programming, the COVID
-19 pandemic, and
any conflicts with my social life. </p>

                                              <p>Working in a team and only knowing each other for a short time, we have
discovered some strengths that we come together to create. These
include our flexibility in how we work together, both in scheduling and
actual work performed. We also create a diversity of experience,
attitudes, and skills. We share a strong work ethic that allows us to stay
up-to-date and perform our assignments well. We are also fortunate
enough to have personalities that mesh, creating a fun work
environment and keeping morale high. All of these strengths make us an
effective team and, more than that, a productive group of
friends. However, as most teams do, we have our share of
weaknesses. To a certain extent, we do suffer from groupthink, which
can occasionally stunt our ability to think creatively and arrive at a
powerful solution. Additionally, only two members of our four person
team have met each other due to physical distance and COVID-19. Our
situation does present some opportunities, though, which we plan to
take advantage of to develop ourselves even further. Our diverse skill
sets and backgrounds give us all the opportunity to learn from each
other and share our strengths. We can provide each other feedback and
collaborate together to create high-quality products. By sharing
leadership experiences throughout the semester, we will all develop the
requisite skills for such a roll. We also have our fair share of threats we
must overcome. One downside of our good team chemistry is that we
are prone to getting distracted at times. Additionally, COVID-19 poses a
risk to our team’s ability to produce as any of us could get
sick. Furthermore, the time commitment of recruiting can cause stress
and draw us away from our academic responsibilities at times. Lastly, as
all teams will surely experience from time to time, conflicts could create
unpleasant work environments that will take time to resolve </p>
